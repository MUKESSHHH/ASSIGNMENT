# Data Analyst Assignment — Company HR Management Database

## 📄 Project Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts, Python notebooks, and spreadsheet files used to create and analyze a **Company HR Management Database**. The goal of this project is to simulate a realistic HR database environment — covering employee data, departments, roles, and related information — and to provide a foundation for data analytics, reporting, and querying.  

Key aims:  
- Design a relational database schema to manage HR data.  
- Populate the database with example data (employees, departments, roles, etc.).  
- Provide SQL scripts to create tables, insert data, and perform queries/analysis for typical HR-related tasks (e.g., employee listing, department-wise counts, salary analysis).
